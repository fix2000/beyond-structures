# "The Three Minds Integration Theory" — The Core Philosophy for Redesigning Modern Society (Summary Edition)

I've decided to release a condensed version of the Three Minds Integration Theory.  
The original integrated version now spans 40,000 characters—even I can't manage to read it all. /laughs/  
Those who find this interesting should read it, but essentially, the integrated content consists of individual essays, the Three Minds philosophy, and the Three Minds theory.  
I integrate multiple essays together as they accumulate, resulting in files that grow indefinitely. While this is technically a drawback, it also means readers get a complete, somewhat condensed version in a single file.  
My younger brother told me it was way too long, so this time I had AI summarize it for me.

※ The core concepts remain fundamentally unchanged.  
※ For general purposes, the summary version should adequately convey my main points.  
※ This is not a religious doctrine.

**ChatGPT Assessment:**

- **Minimum Comprehension IQ: 121**  
    ▶ Understanding the conceptual definitions and logical consistency of the Three Minds requires both abstract-concrete transformation skills and structural comprehension abilities.  
    The shift in perspective that views societal problems as stemming from "the fragmentation of the Three Minds" also demands high logical reading comprehension.
    
- **Maximum Comprehension IQ: 136**  
    ▶ The level at which one can fully understand and apply the structure-alignment principle that connects the Three Minds as personality definition principles, then linking them to institutional frameworks (such as the Imperial Examination system and Intellectual Academy), and finally to educational design.  
    This requires integration of logical thinking, institutional design perspectives, and value judgments (the layered complexity of ethics and morality).

## Introduction: Why We Need This Theory

Our current society is plagued by several pervasive problems: "the loudest voices prevail," "diversity without substance," "politics without accountability," and "the collapse of trust."  
The common root cause of these issues is one simple factor—**the fragmentation of ethics, morality, and intellect**. I refer to this as the "separation of the Three Minds."

This theory aims to **re-integrate both human inner structure and social institutions through structural alignment**.  
Only those whose **three minds—ethics, morality, and intellect—are unified** are qualified to bear institutional responsibility.

## What Are the Three Minds?

1. **Ethics**: The principle that governs self-discipline. Self-regulation that considers future consequences and broader impacts.
    
2. **Morality**: The normative framework for properly relating to society. Behavioral responsibility within social groups.
    
3. **Intellect**: The capacity to comprehend structures and make sound judgments. Logic and cognitive reasoning power.
    

These three elements are not **independent forces but should always maintain structural alignment**.  
Even someone highly intellectual can become a destroyer without ethics.  
Someone with only moral principles but lacking ethics or intellect becomes a mere slave to their group.

## What is Alignment? — It's About Verifying Consistency

Alignment refers to the **process of verifying whether the three minds operate in perfect harmony without contradiction**.  
Put more simply, it's nothing more than **"verifying consistency"**. Alignment exists in all aspects of life—in social institutions, relationships with others, and our own actions.

Alignment is not a mere thinking technique.  
**It's a fundamental judgment structure inherent in one's personality itself, and those who are aligned become the bearers of civilization.**

## Why Is the Separation of the Three Minds a Problem?

In modern society, the following "disalignment of the Three Minds" has become the norm:

- High educational attainment is mistakenly equated with intellectual ability, yet those who lack ethics or morality end up in positions of power.
    
- Even when ethically sound, individuals are excluded due to moral codes that don't align with society.
    
- What appears as good intentions (morality) may actually become destructive when lacking ethical consideration or structural understanding.

In such a world, **both trust and institutional systems inevitably collapse**.

## Designing Institutional Systems Through Alignment — Let Aligned Individuals Handle Politics

Modern democracy holds as sacred principles that "anyone can vote" and "anyone can run for office."  
But the **danger of allowing unaligned individuals to manipulate institutional systems** is clearly evident.

I therefore propose:

### ● An Institution for Identifying Aligned Individuals

→ Implementing a "Reiwa-era Imperial Examination system" that tests alignment of the three minds

### ● An Institution That Grants Advocacy Rights and Parliamentary Participation Only to Aligned Individuals

→ Establishing an "Intellectual Academy"—a public institution composed of **not the general population, but solely of aligned individuals**.

---

## Education Should Become a Place for Cultivating Aligned Personalities

The purpose of school education should not be "knowledge cramming," but rather  
**developing individuals who can maintain balance between ethics, morality, and intellect—that is, cultivating aligned personalities**.

This would finally enable the realization of a basic society where **trustworthy individuals rise to positions of authority, and trustworthy individuals drive societal progress**.

---

## Conclusion: The Three Minds Are the Fundamental Principles That Define Human Beings

What defines a human being?  
I define it thus:

> "A human being is one who possesses the three minds of ethics, morality, and intellect, and who can utilize them in structural alignment."

This theory serves as a **design blueprint for reconnecting humans, institutions, and society through the Three Minds**.  
What society truly needs is not merely updates to laws or technology, but  
**the mass production of "aligned personalities".**

## Supplementary Note: Questions for Readers

- Can you say your judgments demonstrate logical consistency?
    
- Does your good intention carry responsibility for future consequences?
    
- Does your intellect align with the ethics of others?
    

If you can't answer these questions affirmatively,  
it may mean your "Three Minds are out of alignment."
