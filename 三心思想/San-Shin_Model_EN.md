# What Is “San-Shin”? — A Unified Model of Ethics, Morality, and Intelligence

## 🔱 What is the San-Shin Model?

**San-Shin (三心)** is a structural model composed of three foundational human faculties:  
**Ethics**, **Morality**, and **Intelligence**.

These are not isolated ideals, but **a hierarchical and mutually responsive system**.  
They function as layered principles guiding institutional design, education, politics, and societal coherence.

---

## 1. Ethics — A Transcendent Basis of Universal Principles

- The highest axis of judgment in any social or institutional framework.
    
- Concerned not with short-term gain or local consensus, but with **future generations and civilizational integrity**.
    
- Serves as the **normative axis** in system design.
    

> Examples: the value of life, inviolability, ends-in-themselves, triage-based prioritization.

## 2. Morality — Internalized Responsibility Through Reflexivity

- The **application of ethics to the self** in system design or social judgment.
    
- Entails **self-inclusion** within the institutional or moral structure one engages with.
    
- Assumes that "those who define justice must be subject to it."
    

> Example: designing rules while acknowledging oneself as a potential offender or beneficiary.

---

## 3. Intelligence — The Capacity to Reveal and Construct Hidden Structures

- Not mere information processing or knowledge retention.
    
- A **synthetic capacity**: to detect deep structure, articulate it in language, and implement it in institutional forms.
    
- Enables the translation of social logic into legible systems.
    

> Examples: laws, appointment criteria, social architecture, selection and evaluation systems.

## 📐 The Hierarchical Integration of San-Shin

San-Shin functions as a unified chain:

`Ethics (Why / Value Principles)    ↓ Morality (How / Self-Application)    ↓ Intelligence (What / Design & Expression)`

This chain must **not be broken**:

- **Morality without Ethics** becomes populist appeasement.
    
- **Intelligence without Morality** yields cynical bureaucracy.
    
- **Ethics without Intelligence** decays into abstract idealism.
    

True system design demands all three simultaneously.

## 🧠 Domains of Application

|Domain|Method of Application|
|---|---|
|Institutional Design|Use San-Shin as the basis for evaluation, selection, and design reflexivity.|
|Education|Teach ethical reasoning, self-responsibility, and expressive competence in stages.|
|AI Society|Embed human-centered design and ethical oversight into AI systems.|
|Politics / Elections|Require candidates to demonstrate ethical intent, moral embodiment, and structural intelligence.|
|Evaluation Systems|Evaluate character structure through San-Shin, rather than external IQ-type metrics.|

## 📝 Conclusion

**San-Shin is the structural core of meaningful design** — a key to overcoming fragmentation, disillusionment, and institutional dysfunction in modern society.

Every system blueprint, educational proposal, and social critique in this repository is designed with **San-Shin as its central axis**.

> A society designed without San-Shin will always leave someone behind.
